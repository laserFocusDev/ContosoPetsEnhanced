# ContosoPetsEnhanced
As part of Microsoft’s C# foundational course on freeCodeCamp, I built this beginner-friendly pet adoption app through a guided project. This is my version of it with some enhancements to add a little spice! It was a great hands-on way to solidify my C# fundamentals and explore practical application design.

⚠️ This project is based on a guided tutorial from Microsoft’s C# course on freeCodeCamp. The original concept is theirs, but the implementation and enhancements here are my own.

This project is a beginner-friendly console application for managing adoptable pets.  
I've made a few **enhancements** to spice it up, such as:
1] Tracking adoption status
2] Searching by pet nickname
3] Practicing conditionals, loops and arrays. 

##Features
- View all pet info
- Add new pets
- Search pets by nickname *(new!)*
- Check if a pet has been adopted *(new!)*
- Structured using a 2D array

##Tech I've Used:
- Language: C#
- Environment: Console App
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

##License: 
This project is licensed under the MIT license. 

PS: Go easy on me this is my first project ever! I'm learning new things, improving everyday. Feedback is welcome, and if you find something broken… pretend you didn’t. Just kidding. Mostly.
